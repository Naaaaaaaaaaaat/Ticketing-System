Hello and thank you for looking into my ticketing system.

I have constructed this application as a prototype system for resolving problems throughout the company.

Right now it's not incredibly powerful, but do keep in mind that it is just a prototype. I figure'd I'd make this manual
on how to use the program, just becuase it may be a little bit finnicky to less experienced users.

General issues/creating tickets:

-To create a ticket, you will first need to install both files listed below and run main.py
-Next, select the number 1 (The number listed to create a file)
-Afterwards, input the information asked of you by the program.
If you follow these steps your ticket should be created.

-To list tickets, like previously, you will need to run the file with both main and tickets installed.
-Next select the list tickets function
Your tickets should now all be listed

-To resolve a ticket, press 3. All the open tickets will be listed. From here you can go through all of the tickets and find which one
resolve
-Select the ticket to resolve (The ticket number should be shown up top). There may be a bug where the ticket number is displayed
as 1 unit too high (For example, a ticket with the ID of 2001 would actually be recorded in the program as ticket 2000, so to delete
the ticket, you will need to input the number 2000. This is a trend and should work for all tickets)
-Input all the information required to close the ticket and your ticket should now be marked as resolved

-To list all the closed tickets, follow the same steps as in step 2.

Thank you once more for bearing with me, this program it still in it's infancy.
